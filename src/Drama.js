<p className="text-big">In tonight's episode of COLORS BIGG BOSS viewers are in for a treat, but not the contestants owing to new kitchen rules enforced by the master of the house. BIGG BOSS drops a bomb by announcing a drastic change in the kitchen routine according to which members of only one makaan can cook at a time in the kitchen for their housemates.

 The big twist is that the kitchen remains open for cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner only for a designated window. Once the cooking time elapses, the master turns off the stove burner, leaving the contestants to make do with whatever they have managed to cook. Feuds over food are bound to happen, and this bustling space is sure to satiate the viewers craving for entertainment and drama. Who will succumb to the challenges brought by these new rules?</p>
